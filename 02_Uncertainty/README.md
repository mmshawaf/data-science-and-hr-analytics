Made an R file with Professor Kapoorâ€™s code

Interestingly, after running the bootstrap I got a different standard deviation (78 compared to 80), Learned that there can be some differences between bootstrap initializations
Experimented with effect of bootstrap size on bootstrap variance
Ran B = 1000 5 times
78.4, 80.0, 80.8, 78.2, 79.9
Ran B = 5000 5 times
81.1, 80.7, 80.7, 82.4, 79.9
Larger variance with smaller bootstrap size? (small sample size)
