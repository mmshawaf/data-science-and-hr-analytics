Made an R file with Professor Kapoor’s code

Tested different words’ effect on spam:
Spam odds increase by a factor of 5.6 if email contains the word "money".
Spam odds increase by a factor of 2.87 if email contains the word "business".
Spam odds decrease by a factor of 83 if email contains the word "meeting".

Obtained predicted probabilities for observations 300 and 21:
Observation 300 has 61% chance of being spam, 39% for observation 21

Got the same deviance and null deviance when running spammy code as in the lecture slides,  showing that each run is the same
